    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Based out of Portland, OR, Somber's debut EP Night Divorce offers cavernous yet delicately layered soundscapes designed to evoke feelings associated with sleep and restlessness. Through Night Divorce, vocalist Myrrh Crow illustrates the duality of sleep, describing its serenity as well as the haunting isolation that comes with being plagued by night terrors.</p>

    <p>Night Divorce is out July 7th in collaboration with Apneic Void Sounds. On the night of their release, Somber plays at High Water Mark in Portland, OR with TBI, Laiva and Dreams.</p>
